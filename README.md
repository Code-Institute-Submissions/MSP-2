# Video Games Sales - Dashboard - MSP 2

The Video Games Sales Dashboard is used to show the increase in sales of games over the years. The site is interactive in which the charts can show the user the sales information in a visual manner
 
## UX
 
The goal of this website is to show the visual interactions of games sales in three different regions over a long period of time.

The webiste was designed for desktop first as a dashboard would be most effective on a larger screen to display the charts interacting with each other.

In the future I would like to use CSS to make the website look better. I did not use it as I ran out of time and while trying to use it the graphs stopped displaying on the website.

## Features
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- Timeline - allows users to see sales over time
- Barchar - allows users to see genres and platforms in video industry
- Selector - allows users to select a specific publisher

### Features Left to Implement
- In the platform barchart I tried to get only ten bars to view but I was unable to do it.
- In the future I would like to add Bootstap and CSS styling. The reason I did not was that I ran out of time and could not implent it without breaking the current graphs.

## Technologies Used

- Crossfilter.js 
    - The project uses **Crossfilter** to make the graphs interact with each other
- DC.js, D3.js 
    - The project uses **DC.js, D3.js** to make the render the graphs

## Testing

The site was tested using Google chrome developer tools. I clicked on each of the charts to make sure they where interacting with each other and filtering correctly.

-The brush effect for the timeline chart was unable to the work so it was commented out.
-When I added Bootstrap, the selector no longer displayed, so I removed it.

## Deployment

The site was deployed using Github.
